GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3
("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that bears
a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file
is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain
GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The
purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including
proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime
libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Coverage Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input
to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding
that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a
compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler
intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use
of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part
of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Coverage Process is the compilation, during a single Compilation
Process, of both an Independent Module and at least one file of the
Runtime Library by the same version of GCC.

"Eligible Compilation" refers to a Compilation Process where the
version of GCC used is a version of GCC released by the Free Software
Foundation, or is a "Covered Code" as defined in the GPL.

"Eligible Compilation Output" is Target Code generated during an
Eligible Compilation.

An "Eligible Compilation Output file" is one of the files of Target
Code generated during an Eligible Compilation.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by an Eligible Compilation.

You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.
